    <br> I just wanted to write a note but also wanted to immortalize it on the internet :)
    <br><br> okie here goes my note :3

    <br><br>When I first met you, you just looked like that another kid who used to despawn the moment class got over, but as time went on I sorta started falling in love with you, and it's the best thing that has happened to me till date. <br> Period. <br> anyways so as I was saying, I don't really want it to be a love letter, but rather an admiration letter? (does that exist)
    Yeah so first of all, congratulations for making it to the age of 16 years :D, I can't say how hard it must've been but I can definitely say that recently life has been, kinda hard (;)) (imagine me wink now)
    <br> 
    I don't know how to thank the universe for letting me meet you, we made some really good memories, playing table tennis once in a while and EVEN UNO ON DA CHHAT (even on the stairs iykyk ;))
HOW CAN I FORGET DA BUSSSS WEEEE we used to discuss politics and stuff, it was fun :), AND THE EVE AFTER TUITION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)<br> AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, I wanna make more memories with YOUUUUUUUUUUU :)
<br>I KNOW YOU ARE GONNA MISS ME ON YOUR BIRTHDAY BUT NEXT YEAR PAKKA ISTG
<br>I am writing this before I am gonna buy a gift for you, so I hope you'll love whatever I am gonna give you :) ITS GONNA BE A BOOK MOST LIKELY with chomcolate (yum)
<br>Honestly, it's been a hell of a ride, and I just wanna say that I am still glad you are my bestest friend, my first love (ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm lemmme know if you are free again uwu), my bestest girlfriend :), anddddddddddddddddddddd MY FIRST KISS AAAAAAAAAAAA okay i forgor its for your BIRTHDAY
